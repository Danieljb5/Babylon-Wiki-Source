At the dawn of time, 5 gods came together to consolidate their power, and create a planet in their perfect view. Each god worked on their own part of the world, the seas, the land, the animals, the sky and the light. For a time, it was a paradise where everything lived in harmony. However, one species posed an issue, humanity. You see, they had possessed a dangerous gift from the gods, one that could rival and kill them, essence, or as it became known in human society, a soul. As time went on, humanity became more and more powerful, whilst the gods grew weaker and weaker, they knew that they had to strike before it was too late, and so the war for the soul began. The war was extremely bloody, and cost humanity an extreme number of its armies and people, yet they persisted, the power of the essence allowed them to face against impossible odds, and soon great warriors rose. Lionel, the swordsman rose through the ranks as a skilled killer and struck the last blow on the god of the sky, claiming the god’s essence for himself and becoming a god among men. Then, Atraxia the beast king (so named for his mastery over beasts) fought the god of the land head on, becoming critically wounded, yet his subjects gave their lives for his, fuelling him with the essence to finish the fight, and gain the gods essence. Gwyn, an extremely potent sorcerer, used the men he commanded to give their lives for him, and he easily dispatched the god of light with the power he had attained, as well as gaining the gods essence. Lastly man eater cerile butchered all her soldiers, demolishing the god of the sea in battle, gaining his essence. The last god saw the power of humanity, and knew that trying to rival them would be fruitless and so hid. When they could not find the god of life, humanity erected towers that reached into the heavens, one final defiance of the gods and their home, each of the towers with the god killers at the top. The god of life spent decades hiding, before one day, a peasant farmer stumbled across his hiding place. Instead of calling the powers of man and bringing down the punishment of the god killer that was expected, the human showed him kindness and compassion and expressed his hatred of the god killers and their oppressive ways. The god wished to repay the human with anything that he could, however the farmer simply asked the god to take his body when he died, combining the essence of god and humanity to rid the world of the god killers. \
